## Data Structures practice

Goal: for each data structure, solve 2 *easy* problems and 2 *medium* problems.

### Hashing, HashTables
- [x] easy - [unsorted array, find pair that sums to a given N](https://www.techiedelight.com/find-pair-with-given-sum-array/)
- [ ] easy - [is array a subset of another array?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-whether-an-array-is-subset-of-another-array-set-1/?ref=lbp)
- [x] medium - [given a list of tickets, put them into order](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-itinerary-from-a-given-list-of-tickets/?ref=lbp)
- [ ] medium - [number of employees under every manager](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-employees-under-every-manager/?ref=lbp)
